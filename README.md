LIDA Internship Project 1 - Mapping accessibility to food outlets

Healthy Choices, Healthy Lives was a project that developed a ‘proof of concept’ community toolkit to visualise food environment accessibility for a deprived community in Bradford, enabling discussions between local policymakers and residents about future interventions.

The case study describing the outcome of the project can be found here https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/research-projects/healthy-choices-healthy-lives/.

This GitHub repo contains the code and files required to run the application and includes the script that calculates accessibility measures, however the research was conducted on licensed data which cannot be accessed without a subscription.

To use the application, clone the repo and then run either server.r or ui.r.  Alternatively, visit https://tbalbone31.shinyapps.io/lida1healthychoices/ for a web based version.

The application includes a built-in user guide for instructions on functionality.
